# onSlideOver
Letâ€™s imagine HStack full of views. You put down your finger on the leftmost view and lift it up on the rightmost one. What modifier to use for the views in-betweeen just to be notified when the finger is sliding over them? With mouse it would be onHover, but with finger is there anything?

# obfuscated.swift

# firstAttempt.swift 
In this file added modifier fails when touch originated outside
